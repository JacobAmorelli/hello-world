# hello-world
Just a repository by Jake

Greetings and Salutations!

My name is Jake and I just wanted to come here and see what GitHub is all about!
I like media and journalism a lot, so much so that I studied them at university.
I'm just here to have a great time and see what I can learn about coding.

Best,
J
